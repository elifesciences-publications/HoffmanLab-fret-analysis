% WATER
%    A segmentation program based on the algorithm of Zamir et al. (1999)
%    JCS.  Also see Grashoff et al. (2010) Nature.
%
%    The program is meant to read-in a pre-flattened file.  This program
%    does not perform flattening - only thresholding.
% Inputs:
%   imOrig - an image matrix
%   parray - a vector of parameters used by water
%       parray(1) - width of high pass filter
%       parray(2) - intensity threshold after filtering
%       parray(3) - threshold for merging two blobs
% Outputs:
%   final - a mask with blob ids for the provided image
% Sample Call:
%   outim = water(inim,[25,1000,50]);
%   This takes the input image inim and segments out the blobs using the
%   parameters [25,1000,50] returning a mask image with blob ids as outim.
% Required Functions:
%   none


% edits made by Katheryn Rothenberg:
%   receive two inputs - the original image, and array containing the
%       threshold, minimum patch area, and critical patch size for merging
%   return the final label matrix
%   changed line 60 to line 61 so that it was not always a true statement
%   added line 53 to reinitialize the int array for each iteration

% This code 'water' should be considered 'freeware' and may be
% distributed freely (outside of the military-industrial complex) in its
% original form when properly attributed.
